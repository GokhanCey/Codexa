# Codexa  
**Evidence-Powered AI for Smarter Search**

Codexa combines **Elastic Search** and **Google Gemini** to deliver AI answers that are grounded in real data ‚Äî not guesses.  
Upload your documents, ask questions, and get verified insights with full reasoning and context.

---

## Overview  
Most AI tools guess their way to answers. Codexa doesn‚Äôt.  
It connects Elastic‚Äôs fast, context-aware retrieval with Gemini‚Äôs advanced reasoning to create an AI that **explains with evidence**.  

Codexa is designed for professionals, researchers, and developers who want factual, traceable, and intelligent results from their own data.

---

## Features  
- **Evidence-Based Answers** ‚Äì Every response includes reasoning grounded in your own indexed data  
- **Elastic + Gemini Integration** ‚Äì Combines the speed of Elastic with the intelligence of Gemini  
- **Simple Dashboard** ‚Äì Upload PDFs or text files and ask questions instantly  
- **Secure Local API Storage** ‚Äì Uses SQLite for API key management  
- **Modern Interface** ‚Äì Custom dark UI built with clean HTML and CSS

**Codexa Architecture ‚Äî Elastic + Gemini Powered AI Search**

**Workflow:**
1. The user uploads a PDF or text file through the dashboard.  
2. Flask processes and indexes the document into Elastic Cloud.  
3. Elastic retrieves relevant context when a question is asked.  
4. Gemini 2.5 processes that context and returns a summarized, reasoned answer.  
5. Codexa displays the evidence-based result instantly.
